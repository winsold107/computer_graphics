CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:7 (add_subdirectory):
  add_subdirectory given source "external" which is not an existing
  directory.


CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:10 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0026 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
